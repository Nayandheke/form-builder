# Interactive Form Builder

## Overview
The Interactive Form Builder is a drag-and-drop tool for creating customizable forms. Built with React, it allows users to assemble forms using a library of components, validate them, and preview their behavior. The project emphasizes performance optimization and modern development practices, including JSON schema generation and testing.

## Features

### Core Features
1. **Form Component Library**
   - Predefined components: text input, select dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
   
2. **Form Validation**
   - Integration with Zod (or similar libraries) for schema-based validation.

3. **Preview Mode**
   - Test forms in a sandbox environment before deployment.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Utilization of `React.memo` and `useMemo` to enhance rendering efficiency.

5. **JSON Schema Generation**
   - Automatically generate a JSON schema representation of the form for portability and storage.

6. **Unit Tests**
   - Comprehensive testing of form logic to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Bonus Features
1. **Form Templates**
   - Predefined templates for common use cases (e.g., feedback forms, surveys).

2. **Response Visualization**
   - Visualize user responses with charts or tables.

3. **Conditional Logic**
   - Define logic to show/hide form components based on user input.

## Technology Choices and Rationale

### React
- **Why:** Component-based architecture simplifies UI design and encourages reuse.
- **Benefits:** Leverages React.memo and useMemo for performance tuning.

### Zod
- **Why:** Schema-based validation provides clear and maintainable validation rules.
- **Benefits:** Strongly typed validation aligns with TypeScript and modern JavaScript practices.

### Testing Library (Jest/React Testing Library)
- **Why:** Ensures robust functionality with unit and integration tests.

### JSON Schema
- **Why:** A standard format for describing form structures, making the forms portable.

## Known Limitations / Trade-Offs

1. **No Backend Integration**
   - This version does not include backend storage or submission functionality.

2. **Drag-and-Drop Restrictions**
   - The drag-and-drop system is limited to desktop environments; touch support is not fully implemented.

3. **Static Styling**
   - The project uses predefined styles. No theme customization is supported in this version.

4. **Basic Visualization**
   - Response visualization is limited to simple data formats.

## Future Improvements

1. **Touch Support**
   - Enable drag-and-drop functionality for mobile and tablet devices.

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Add APIs for saving forms, retrieving templates, and managing user responses.

3. **Advanced Customization**
   - Support user-defined styles, themes, and branding.

4. **Enhanced Conditional Logic**
   - Allow complex multi-step logic for advanced forms.

5. **Dynamic Visualization**
   - Implement real-time charts and analytics for form responses.
